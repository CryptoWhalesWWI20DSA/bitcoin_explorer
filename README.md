Get useful informations for any block, transaction or address in the Bitcoin Blockchain

The documentaionen for the used API you can find via the following link: https://btc.com/btc/adapter?type=api-doc

Because every output with bitcoin has the unit Sstoshi, this unit has to be converted. Therefore i used the Deno-Module: https://deno.land/x/units@v0.0.2

# Usage of the Unit Converter

```ruby
import { UnitConverter } from "https://deno.land/x/units/mod-bitcoin.ts.ts";

const testData: any[] = []

testData.push({ from: 'Satoshi', amount: NUMBER YOU WANT TO CONVERT, to: 'Bitcoin', expected: 1 })

for (const entry of testData) {
    const result = UnitConverter.convert(entry.from, entry.amount, entry.to)
    return result
}
```
